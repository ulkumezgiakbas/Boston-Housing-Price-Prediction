🏠 Boston Housing Price Prediction

A multivariable regression project using the **Boston Housing dataset**.  
The goal is to predict house prices (`PRICE`) based on multiple features such as crime rate, number of rooms, tax rate, etc.

## 📊 Project Overview

In this project, I practiced the full workflow of regression analysis:

- **Data Preprocessing** with `pandas`
- **Exploratory Data Analysis** using `Seaborn` & `Matplotlib`
- **Multivariable Linear Regression** with `scikit-learn`
- **Residuals Analysis** to check model assumptions
- **Model Evaluation** with MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²
- **Log Transformation** to improve regression performance
- **Sample Prediction** using the trained model

This project is part of my Machine Learning learning path, focused on regression, model evaluation, and data visualization.
It is inspired by the Boston Housing dataset which is a classic ML dataset for regression tasks.
